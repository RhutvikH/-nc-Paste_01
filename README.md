How to use: -

1. install pyautogui via pip: -

```
   pip install pyautogui
```

2. insert the code in the commented slot and run it

3. Get ready with the tab where you want to paste the text within 5 seconds.. the text will be pasted on the screen

_DOES NOT_ work in notepad. detects it as non human writing somehow..

**Possible bugs: -**

**the TAB key** can be typed multiple times, making your code absolutely unreadable..

Can add a bunch more curly braces at the end of the code you type.. tiny bug. just remove the brackets
